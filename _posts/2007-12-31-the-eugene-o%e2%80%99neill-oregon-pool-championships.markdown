<p>I saw Nicholai walking on the beach. I noticed he looked at me, but I walked past. But then I stopped and turned to look at him. He stopped, and we started talking. He was here for the Eugene Pool Championships. That seemed strange to me until he explained that he was on the Eugene team for the national championship here in San Diego. I walked with him into the hotel he was staying in, and we stopped and talked to some people in the lobby. I followed Kait (was Nicholai) down to her hotel room. It was a shared room-- Chris, Kait, Breanna and a mystery follow that looked like that follow at RAF who looks like Bryn. They were watching TV and I had a huge backpack stuffed with things, which I left in the hallway since there was nothing valuable in it. Their room was at the end of a short hallway, right behind the boiler room. A hotel boiler boy came in to make sure our heat was okay. We said it was, and he went into the boiler room. When he had disappeared deep amidst the boilers, Chris rallied everyone to action--I didn't know what was going on-- they had me pull up the curtains on the inside wall of the room. When I had done this, the four of them climbed through a wide hole in the wall into the boiler room, and with a bit of difficulty and the assistance of a rope, they lifted a metal bucket of baked beans out from behind the boiler. Unfortunately as they lifted it through the hole, all the beans spilled onto the carpet. There was scrambling as the boiler boy was coming back from the depths of the boiler room. Kait and Megan (was either Breanna or the mystery follow that looked like the follow that looks like Bryn or that follow at RAF who has hair like Megan's) got back just as the boiler boy returned (he saw them). He came into the room and looked around suspiciously. Then he saw the spilled beans and started yelling at everyone. The four tried to explain how they had arrived last night on a late flight and there had been no place open to buy food, and the room didn't have a microwave, so they had to heat beans over the boilers. The boiler boy was still yelling and shouted, why didn't they get a bag of Doritos (or some other kind of processed junk food)! and we stared at him in disbelief and dismay at the American consumer culture. He was so angry he somehow pinned me on the floor and was crushing my ribcage from the side, making it hard for me to breathe. The end.</p>
