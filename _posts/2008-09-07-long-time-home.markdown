<p>I miss you.  How is it that life keeps pulling us apart?  I imagined when we we first had to part that our separation was only temporary.  We would struggle through the rough parts of life and emerge at the end, free and full of joy and left with plentiful time to spend together.  I thought that eventually our paths would lead us together-- that someday we would walk the <em>same<&#47;em> path.</p>
<p>But no-- as time goes on, paths do not converge.  We are becoming more unique and individual.  Our passions are more specific as we grow more powerful.  We are fulfilling our dreams only to find more dreams behind every cloud.  Accomplishment-- excitement-- living life to the fullest-- our lives now are more full than we ever could have imagined.  And our love of life is that much stronger.</p>
<p>Each day we give of ourselves more fully and strive toward higher goals.  We will build the best of worlds!  And when it is done, when all of creation has been created and every person has lived and died in harmony-- when every song has been sung, every molecule counted and every thought considered-- then I will come home, along the path that I've taken before.  We will sit at the table, smile, and together spend all the time in the world.</p>

<p><strong>For myself,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I called my mom, messaged a new person on OKC and organized the apartment.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had gotten to bed sooner, played piano and cooked something.</p>
<p><strong>For my community,<&#47;strong>&mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I followed through on my plans to hang out with the performance team.  I also emailed people about ULHS planning.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish that I had talked to Jasmine and Krystina and that I had gone dancing and found a low-overhead way to practice with Bonnie.</p>
<p><strong>For others,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I worked out a simpler computer game example for teaching kids.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had posted a craigslist ad for tutoring and that I had started my dance blog.  I wish I had started working on simplifying version control or GUI API.</p>
