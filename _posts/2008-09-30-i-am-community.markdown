<p>"Who are you?" is what the Vorlons ask in Babylon 5.  That same question is the topic of the Landmark Education Advanced Course, which I took this past February.   Who I am is community.  </p>
<p>It's easy for me to pretend that isn't true.  I was shy in school, and I mostly kept to myself all through college.  I spent most of my time working on my own art projects, computer projects, and exploring the campus.  I was smart, so it was easy for me to use schoolwork as an excuse to isolate myself.  But despite all the pretending, I'll still talk for hours about a future where I'll be able to live and work in the midst of a group of inspired, creative people.</p>
<p>When I moved to San Diego, most of the social time I had was spent dancing.  My dream for dancing has always been that dancing should be an activity that is available to anyone and welcomes anyone.  Four years later, I've managed to keep myself fairly distant from most of the dancers, but still the dream remains.</p>
<p>In Babylon 5, the Vorlons kept asking their question because they themselves didn't have an answer to it.  And perhaps I am acting out that same irony, because my biggest dreams of community are the places where I've felt the most isolated: school and dancing.  I sometimes wonder if my dreams are so large simply because I've been so hurt and frustrated in those areas.</p>
<p>I was just talking to to Sarah the other day about redefining school to be more of a learning community of people rather than a body of students.  In fact I've been blessed to find myself part of (the beginning of) such a school now, Innovations Academy, a "community of learners".  And perhaps it's no coincidence that both of my past girlfriends have at some point talked about starting a schools with similar ideals.  Maybe it's not such an uncommon dream.  Or maybe we all felt the same isolation I did during my school years.  Strangely we never talked about those ideas during our relationships-- the subject only came up long afterwards.  If we had realized it at the time, I bet that common goal could have been a powerful foundation to build a relationship on.</p>
<p>But enough about the past-- my actions haven't matched my dreams, but I will take this moment to redeclare myself.  I am community, I live for community, and I contribute community to the world--that's going to be the impact of my life.</p>
<p>So, it's time for a self-assessment.  Here's where I've recently acted inconsistently with being community:  I didn't go to Bing's last week.  I didn't go to Lunch 2.0 last week.  I didn't go to Danielle's potluck a few weeks ago.  I didn't give a talk at Barcamp last spring.  I didn't say hello to Susan or Susan on Saturday.  I've avoided talking to Lauren.  I haven't called my grandparents or my brother.  I didn't follow up with Jim about having a Big Apple practice.  I haven't organized any gatherings in the last month.  I haven't called my ex-coworkers.</p>
<p>Actions?  I will give a talk at Barcamp in November, and I will stay for the whole weekend.  I will schedule the phone calls that I want to make.  I will take 10 minutes at dances to greet people.</p>
