<p>Two weeks ago, I revised my budget to get back on track with my savings goals...  The result was that from my last pay check, I had only $20 to spend on food for the following two weeks.  I figured that was nearly impossible, since I need about 2700 calories&#47;day; so to be able to survive, I needed to somehow get 1,900 calories per dollar spent!  (A few foods come close to 1900 calories per pound, but about the only things that are 1900 calories per dollar are cases of Ramen noodles and sacks of rice-- try adding any vegetables, fruit or protein into your diet, and there's no way to eat that cheaply.)</p>
<p>But despite the seemingly-impossible goal, here I am two weeks later, with $8.20 left over!  I got my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Community-supported_agriculture">CSA<&#47;a> delivery yesterday, and now I'm in the clear!  Tomorrow's my next paycheck, and now I've got $60 for groceries, and $20 for eating out-- it's time for a feast!</p>
<p>It was really tough-- I started out eating my stockpile of rice, oatmeal and carrots that have been accumulating around the house; then for a bit of variety I added in the green onions, beets and lettuce which were thankfully still just fresh enough to eat.  Getting tired of that, I realized I had plenty of flour and looked up some baking recipes only to realize that it was a rare recipe that did not require milk, butter or eggs-- but I eventually found a sugar-cookie recipe that only called for shortening.  When I'd stretched those stocks as far as I could stand, I went shopping...  I bought bananas, butter and ground beef (the highest-calorie fruit, fat and protein that I could think of).  Luckily I still had plenty of lettuce and salad dressing left around the house.  Yesterday my delivery brought strawberries, apples, oranges, and some much fresher vegetables!</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, I've typically been spending $400-$500 per month on food; but for April I'm now on track to spend about one fifth of that-- I think that's amazing!  It's actually been really refreshing not to have to buy things :)</p>
