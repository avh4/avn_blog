<p>Alex left town sometime last week.  I'm not sure when; he didn't tell me.  Instead, our last moments together were spent habitat maps of migratory birds and considering the impact of global climate change on biodiversity.</p>
<p>Actually those moments were more or less our first moments together as well as our last.  I had only really talked with him once before, and the tone of the conversation made me feel like he didn't think I thought of him as a friend.</p>
<p>So I feel somewhat responsible for the way things turned out.  I never made more than a fleeting effort to get to know him or to spend time with him.  I never invited him to dinner, never asked what he was doing with his life, never inquired about bird-watching.  I was the same inconsiderate stranger that I've secretly criticized Californians for being to me.  It was behavior definitely inconsistent with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;aaron.vonderhaar.name&#47;2008&#47;09&#47;30&#47;i-am-community&#47;">being community<&#47;a>.</p>
