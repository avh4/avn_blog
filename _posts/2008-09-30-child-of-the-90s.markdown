<p>I was sorting out my music collection today when I came across Barenaked Ladies.  I got my first album of theirs, Born on a Pirate Ship, during spring break of my freshman year of college.  Jenn was an ardent fan of them, but I never really took music recommendations very seriously--I think it's too personal.  So instead I picked up the album completely by chance from the discount rack at Meijer.  For anyone who doesn't know, stretch your mouth open with your fingers (like the boy on the cover) and say "I was born on a pirate ship".  That was a trick I learned back in third grade.</p>
<p>It was a great album!  I was at first blown away by the intricacy of the lyrics.  But what I still love now after all these years is how each song is so distinct from all the others.  I find it amazing how much variety they were able to produce.  I could listen to that album for hours savoring the taste of each song.  As I started to get familiar with the songs, they could have almost as much emotional effect on me as the changing of the seasons.  It made me reflect a lot on my relationships with people.  And they were good for some expressive dancing.</p>
<p>I told this to my mom once (she's a big Beatles fan): because if you'll remember, when John Lennon was asked where the name "Beatles" came from, he said that it came to him in a dream...  So I always imagined Steven Page being asked the same questions and replying with a story of how they were trying to come up with a name, hoping and praying for inspiration, and then, one night, bare-naked ladies came to him in a dream.</p>
<p>I ended up getting the rest of their albums that summer (that was shortly after Maroon came out).  I also bought myself a minidisc player (I had seen them in Belgium the summer before) and I copied all their CDs onto a minidisc.  I had a few other minidiscs that I filled: 4-hand Rachmaninoff piano suites, Count Basie and Duke Ellington, the Counting Crows, and Billie Holiday and Carmen McRae.  But I think Barenaked Ladies got the most play time during the many long bus trips I took to visit Laura that semester.</p>
<p>The Michigan Greyhound didn't have very nice routes considering that Ann Arbor and Lansing are the two big college towns (and actually it appears to be worse now).  To get between them you had to go by way of Battle Creek, and there was an official lunch stop at McDonald's along the way.  Listening to Maroon is always going to remind me of that route, pulling in and out of the Jackson and Battle Creek bus stations, and running through the pouring rain to get to catch the 4am bus so that I could get back in time for an exam.</p>
<p>There's a lot of my life, hopes, dreams, and fears tied up with Barenaked Ladies.  Maybe You Should Drive still makes me blush thinking about my future wife.  It makes me remember all the embarrassing things I did too!  Laura introduced me to Dar Williams (and later Ani DiFranco), who ended up carrying me through a lot more than Barenaked Ladies did (though she did have some help from Margaret Atwood).  But that's another story.</p>
<p>P.S. Liz, I will send you that Duke Ellington song-- I didn't forget!</p>
