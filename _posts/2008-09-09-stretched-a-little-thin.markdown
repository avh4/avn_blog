<p>I decided not to post again today.  I have some good topics, but I've been too slow in finishing up chores.  But here's my self-assessment:</p>
<p><strong>For myself,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I called Jasmine and sent a public email to Tara Hunt (both nerve-wracking).  I also replied to all my emails for today (three days in a row!)  I also posted an ad for my tutoring business.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wanted to have gotten to sleep sooner and woken up sooner.  I wanted to have an additional hour's worth of effectiveness in cleaning my apartment.  I wish I had called Krystina and invited Liz to the dance.</p>
<p><strong>For my community,<&#47;strong>&mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I created a great night of dancing by inviting several people to come.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wanted to have had more epic conversations with people.  I also wish I had talked to Patrick about some of my project ideas.</p>
<p><strong>For others,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I started making myself known and getting myself involved with the HeroCamp group.  I made another try at profoundly influencing kids.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had written my blog post about space exploration.  I wish I had watched the TED video of Ian Dunbar a day earlier-- it would have helped me with teaching today.</p>
