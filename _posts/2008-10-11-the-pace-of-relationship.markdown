<p>I had thought things were going pretty well.  But talking to people at Showdown today, it seems like everyone has been through two or three relationships since the last time I saw them.  And I haven't had any.  I've been spending my time doing a lot of great things, and I feel like I've really made a difference in the world in the past several months.  But I wonder if I've been burying myself in work to hide from the fact that I still end up alone every night.</p>
<p>Back in college, Lee once commented to me how weird and mysterious it is how people go from being friends or acquaintances to being in a relationship.  I recently had been feeling that the mystery was behind me and that when the next good opportunity for a relationship came along, I'd be ready for it.  But seeing how fast other people are doing it makes me feel like I'm out of the loop again.  At the time, I thought it would happen between me and Lee.  It didn't happen, and I really wanted it to--I was so fascinated by the way she would talk about seemingly any topic, and by her focus and by her optimism.  I never figured out what went wrong, and I'm still sad and disappointed with myself that I couldn't figure out how to start a relationship with her.</p>
<p>So I left the dance for a few minutes to sit under a tree and dismantle my racket.  I do feel a lot better after recognizing the cover-up, although it's so easy to fall back on the anger:</p>
<p>My persistent complaint is: that no one takes the time to get to know me.<br />
My fixed way of being is: angry and exasperated.<br />
What I'm pretending is: that it's not urgent for me to find a relationship.<br />
What I'm covering up is: that I think I'm better than other men.<br />
The payoff is: I get to be right and make others wrong; I get to avoid domination.<br />
The impact on myself and others is: I isolate myself from talking with and having friendships with men; I constantly feel like I need to prove myself to women, which prevents them from seeing the real me.<br />
(did I miss any steps?)</p>

<p>I did miss a step, as Danielle reminds me http:&#47;&#47;avh4.livejournal.com&#47;7457.html :</p>
<p>The possibility I am creating for myself and my life is: the possibility of joyful self-expression and playfulness.</p>
