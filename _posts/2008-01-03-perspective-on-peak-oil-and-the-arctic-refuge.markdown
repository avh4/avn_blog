<p>So I got a newsletter in the mail explaining to me an urgent matter of environmental concern: drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  I like to understand things visually, so I was glad they included this graph which clearly explained the crisis and the obvious solution:<br><br><center><img src="http:&#47;&#47;a278.ac-images.myspacecdn.com&#47;images01&#47;109&#47;l_2ed88d95bc956c92049ea05ac5144445.png"&#47;><&#47;center><br><br>The caption reads, "A national commitment to oil savings could yield more than 15 times the output from the Arctic Refuge cumulatively over the next 20 years."<br><br>Well that sounds great-- Clearly we should invest in improved fuel economy and other measure and forget about drilling the Arctic Refuge!<br><br>But they've left out an important point: how this issue relates to the rest of the world.  Here is the same graph using the same scale as the original, but I've added the predicted U.S. and World oil consumption rates:<br><br><center><img src="http:&#47;&#47;a535.ac-images.myspacecdn.com&#47;images01&#47;5&#47;l_93b57c5a970b0ea75b3abcbc00dbeaf6.png"&#47;><&#47;center><br><br>You start to get the feeling of what impact Arctic drilling might have on the big picture-- not very much.  And while we're talking about the big picture, let's add one more thing to this graph (and scale it down to a reasonable size):<br><br><center><img src="http:&#47;&#47;a703.ac-images.myspacecdn.com&#47;images01&#47;20&#47;l_f5a399a3ee8bb3fec48ca83fd409abee.png"&#47;><&#47;center><br><br>These new lines shows how much oil is predicted to be produced, and you may notice that we are consuming more oil than we're producing.  This graph interestingly puts another debate into perspective:  regardless of whether oil production has already peaked or will peak in 30 years, <i>we are already in an oil deficit<&#47;i>-- oil production is already lagging demand by 10 million barrels per day!  (And remember, Arctic Drilling was going to produce less than 1 million barrels per day-- and only after a 20-year ramp-up period.)  Clearly there are more serious problems than Arctic drilling.<br><br>So next time you see a dramatic graph, please, check the facts and make sure the graph is dramatic enough.  And don't forget to be wary of graphs that don't cite their data sources ;)</p>
