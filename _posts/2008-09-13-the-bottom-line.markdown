<p>I'm going to get straight to the point with my self-assessment tonight:</p>
<p>I could have ended war today, and I didn't.  I say I want to end war, but I didn't take the actions necessary to end it.</p>
<p>I'm not going to end war tomorrow.  I'm going to hide; I'm going to content myself working on small problems and try to ignore the big ones that are destroying us.  Tomorrow I'm going to prepare my new class material for Sunday, which is the first step in revolutionizing computer programming education.  I'm going to pretend that working toward improved education makes up for the fact that I'm not ending war.</p>
