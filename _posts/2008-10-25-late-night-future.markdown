<p>I don't feel like I have time either to blog or to brainstorm about projects, so instead I'm going to do both at the same time and hope that that will take less time than doing either one individually.</p>
<p>I want to make a difference with my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.perfectspace.com&#47;2008&#47;10&#47;15&#47;the-power-of-the-project&#47;">projects<&#47;a>, so I wanted to brainstorm what areas there are for which I think there is responsibility to be taken.  The idea is that I can start creating a list of project ideas that I can go to "any time I'm bored" (as <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;missrogue">Tara Hunt<&#47;a> described today).</p>
<p>Areas:</p>
<p>Politics, local politics, social policy, consumer activism, agreement realities, inspiration to advance technology, inspiration to create a bond of brotherhood</p>
<p>environmentalism, economic responsibility, health education, diversity education, tolerance education</p>
<p>educational effectiveness, building communities, connecting similar people, connecting diverse people</p>
<p>safety, household safety, internet safety, supporting people in times of crisis, supporting people in times of doubt</p>
<p>foreign relations, empowerment of the base, artistic expression, exposure to the arts, appreciation of new cultures, acceptance of subcultures</p>
