<p>Mistakes with women-- I've made two so far this week.</p>
<p>I was joking with a girl in line at the grocery store. &Acirc;&nbsp;She was one of those people who is so mysteriously easy to talk to that it catches you off-guard and makes you wonder if you're dreaming. &Acirc;&nbsp;After she swiped her club card, I stopped talking. &Acirc;&nbsp;I was suddenly worried about inconveniencing her. &Acirc;&nbsp;"I don't want her to miss hearing how much she's saved today." &Acirc;&nbsp;Irrationally worried :( &Acirc;&nbsp;"It's important that she not be distracted while she precision-pilots the shopping card." &Acirc;&nbsp;I waited for a good moment to speak up again... &Acirc;&nbsp;Predictably, my warped concept of "good" never showed up.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I should have taken my time. &Acirc;&nbsp;I was at the movies, and I heard someone calling my name-- a cute girl, in fact! &Acirc;&nbsp;I knew her from swing dancing. &Acirc;&nbsp;I've only talked with her once, but she has this incredibly attractive energy around her. &Acirc;&nbsp;I flightily introduced her to Teresa and then... rushed off to meet the rest of our group inside, feeling like I was late because I had gotten lost in the parking lot. &Acirc;&nbsp;"Oh, there'll be time to talk to her later" &Acirc;&nbsp;... unless she was seeing a different movie, which clearly she was. &Acirc;&nbsp;"Oh, I'll see her the next time I go dancing" &Acirc;&nbsp;... unless she doesn't regularly come out, which apparently (and obviously, in retrospect) she doesn't. &Acirc;&nbsp;I felt like a moron almost immediately after getting inside.</p>
<p>Is there hope for me?</p>
