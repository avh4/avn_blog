<p>"Hi, how are you?"</p>
<p>I realized today this isn't a question: it's a choice.  When someone asks how I am, they're not requesting me to probe deep into my feelings and describe my emotional and physical state.  "I'm happy! how are you?"  They're asking me how I want to be responded to today.  This is much different from a report.  It's actually my opportunity to set the tone of the conversation, and even change my mood on a dime.  This is the most exciting part of the conversation, because I'm free to create anything I want!  "How am I?"  I could say anything, and the other person is gladly going to play to whatever "how I am" that I choose.  Happy?  Sad?  Resigned?  Playful?  Meticulous?  Blessed?  How do I want to be listened to today?  I can be anyone I want to be.</p>
<p>&mdash; Hi, how are you?</p>
<p>&mdash; I'm the person I've always wanted to be but my whole life have been scared that I'd never deserve.  How are you?</p>
