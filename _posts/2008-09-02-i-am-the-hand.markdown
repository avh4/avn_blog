<p>There are a few days in the year that always feel like the beginning of an era every time they come around: &Acirc;&nbsp;New Year's, of course; November 1st; that day somewhere between April and June when summer suddenly appears; and Labor Day.</p>
<p>Today is Labor Day, and tomorrow school starts. &Acirc;&nbsp;For the last couple years I haven't had anything to do with school, and now I suddenly find myself back to it, but on a side that I've never been on before. &Acirc;&nbsp;I'm watching as my students at Wintriss Tech get their first weeks of school after the summer, and bracing myself as Innovations Academy opens its doors to 150 students. &Acirc;&nbsp;I've always seen myself as the student, but now I'm seeing a different perspective.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I've recently been thinking about how I can get my students engaged in the real world-- I want then to use real tools, solve real problems-- I don't want to teach them, I want to show them life. &Acirc;&nbsp;And in thinking about that I've been looking at how my life is different now from my life in school.</p>
<p>I think the big difference is that as a student, I was waiting. &Acirc;&nbsp;I was gathering knowledge, honing my skills, and waiting for life to start. &Acirc;&nbsp;I didn't mind spending hours working out a hopelessly complex math problem or imagining the society that might exist among a race of nomad aliens. &Acirc;&nbsp;I would go to concerts and plays and walk across campus to see art exhibits because I didn't feel like I had anything more important to do other than wait.</p>
<p>This past week I've started feeling comfortable with teaching--it's not a novelty to me any more--and I've had to keep asking myself why I do what I do. &Acirc;&nbsp;I want to change the world, be influential, spread joy, yank the covers off of the empowerment of people. &Acirc;&nbsp;And as I get comfortable in my new situations, I'm noticing that sometimes I hesitate. &Acirc;&nbsp;I have a lot of big ideas, but many of them have no action behind them and still don't after all this time.</p>
<p>So I guess that leaves room for only one thing: action!</p>
