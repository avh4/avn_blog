<p>I've been hearing a lot about the power of "conversation" recently&mdash; conversation as an educational tool, conversation as a software development method, conversation as a source of creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>"The most powerful instructional technology ever invented is human conversation."&mdash; Jay Cross <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=NlETGJ0mnno">"Informal Learning in 10 minutes"<&#47;a></p>
<p>"It is essential to zero in on the fact that teaching and learning are really two different functions&hellip;  It takes communication <i>skills<&#47;i> for teachers to become effective in making those connections, creating those links, and building those bridges."&mdash; Gordon Training <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.gordontraining.com&#47;artman2&#47;uploads&#47;1&#47;What_Every_Teacher_Should_Know.pdf">What Every Teacher Should Know (PDF)<&#47;a></p>
<p>"We have come to value &hellip; individuals and interactions over processes and tools"&mdash; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;agilemanifesto.org&#47;">Manifesto for Agile Software Development<&#47;a></p>
<p>"What I find most effective for deep, innovative learning is a &hellip; profound, engaging, meaningful conversation"&mdash; <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.elearningguild.com&#47;content.cfm?selection=doc.855#sawyer">GuildCast interview with Keith Sawyer<&#47;a>, author of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.goodreads.com&#47;book&#47;show&#47;1201325.Group_Genius_The_Creative_Power_of_Collaboration">Group Genius<&#47;a></p>

<p><strong>For myself,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I bought and ate organic food, and avoided impulse buys.  I replied to all my email for the day.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had gone to bed earlier by way of working more efficiently in the afternoon and washed the dishes.</p>
<p><strong>For my community,<&#47;strong>&mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I replied to blog comments.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had inspired people in conversation.  I wish I had connected with people more powerfully.</p>
<p><strong>For others,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  Updated the enrollment information for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;innovationsacademy.org">Innovations Academy<&#47;a>.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had started an organization to provide technology education and resources to the public.  I wish I had brought peace and hope.</p>
