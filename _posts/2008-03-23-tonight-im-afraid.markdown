<p>Tonight, I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid.<br><br>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that nothing I do is going to make a difference in life.  <br><br>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that my brother is going to get stuck in a career that he hates.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that my dad will never be satisfied with himself.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that my mother will give up on education.<br><br>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that Heather thinks I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m desperate.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that I&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll never get Lauren&acirc;&euro;&trade;s attention.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that Liz is desperate to avoid me.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that Megan will never trust me.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that I will always recognize my faults a moment too late.<br><br>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that I will never finish anything of importance.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that it&acirc;&euro;&trade;s impossible to get enough sleep and still keep up with people&acirc;&euro;&trade;s expectations.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that the world is getting screwed up faster than I can fix it.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that no one knows my name.  I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that people who listen to me will be worse off than they were before.<br><br>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that I will never be able to communicate my dreams and passions to others.<br><br>I&acirc;&euro;&trade;m afraid that the future is uncertain.<br><br>Amen.</p>
