<p>Today I was community.  I hadn't set specific goals for myself, but the measurable results today were so obvious that I couldn't miss them:</p>
<p>The number of people who unexpectedly expressed sincere appreciation of me: <b>4<&#47;b><br />
The number of extraordinary actions people around me took as a result of my involvement: (at least) <b>5<&#47;b><br />
The number of unexpected social invitations I received: <b>4<&#47;b><br />
The number of people I felt connected to for the first time: <b>8<&#47;b><br />
The number of phone calls I made: <b>6<&#47;b><br />
The number of people who see something completely new in life as a result of my involvement: (at least) <b>27<&#47;b></p>
<p>(My general average for all those measures is very close to zero.)</p>
<p>I'm not sure what else to write about today.  I'm going to relax tonight.  I've done a lot of things in the past two days that in the past have made me really uncomfortable.  I always tend to worry that people don't want me around or that they don't want my input.  I'm afraid of social situations and especially of group dynamics because I'm afraid that I'll say the wrong thing and make the situation bad for everyone.  But slowly I've been training myself to push all that aside and to just do what I honestly believe needs to be done.  I'm so scared of being seen as a jerk or of getting myself into a situation that is beyond my control.  But these last two days I haven't given a second thought to my traditional hesitations, and I am simply amazed by the results!  I am so full of joy and love right now and I feel so amazed at people and so connected.  I've always thought a lot about the people around me, but today I actually made those relationships a reality.  I'm pretty wound-up and excited, so if you don't mind I'm going to take a short break from community and be peace for a few hours.  Feel free to carry on while I'm away :-D</p>
