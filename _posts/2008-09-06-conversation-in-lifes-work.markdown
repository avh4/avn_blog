<p>I've been thinking over my week (and the past month) and realizing how typical it is for me to work alone.  I've had few moments in my life where I've been focused and productive while working with someone.  Most often, when I am productive or thinking or planning or creating, I do it apart from other people.  Even on collaborative projects, the work will be broken into distinct pieces and given out to people to work on alone.</p>
<p>This week I've heard <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.spunlabs.com&#47;">Llewellyn<&#47;a> talk a lot about pairing and how very effective it is for software development.  There are several benefits: the spreading of knowledge, enhanced focus and motivation, and full-coverage sanity checking.  There's also something harder to measure: increased creativity, and what Llewellyn calls Excellence.  The benefits are pretty extreme, so why doesn't pairing happen naturally?</p>
<p>For me it's difficult to put myself in a pairing environment because I have a need to be comfortable with my understanding of something before I start work.  Even worse than than, I'm reluctant to talk to people about things that I can't clearly explain.  So it's difficult for me to open up to someone while I'm working.  And I'm not in the habit of communicating verbally in large volume.</p>
<p>So I've noticed that the thought of pairing makes me nervous.  But the thought of pairing and collaboration is also exciting.  I've never been a collaborative person, and I've never talked much about what I do with my time.  But I'm going to redefine myself with actions.  My blogging for the last four days is part of that.  And creating some collaborative projects is another.  I've decided to make challenge for myself to involve another person in every single personal project that I work on.  It's going to be a huge shift, to take a mostly-alone life and turn it into a mostly-paired life, but I'm awed by the possibility.</p>

<p><strong>For myself,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I replied to all my email for the day.  I didn't use my car.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had gone to bed earlier and been more focused when I had conversations with people.  I also wish I had talked to Erin.</p>
<p><strong>For my community,<&#47;strong>&mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  I supported Jelly by attending. &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had posted an advertisement for tutoring and made future plans to spend time with someone.  </p>
<p><strong>For others,<&#47;strong>  &mdash;<em>What did I do today?<&#47;em>  Not much.  &mdash;<em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em>  I wish I had gotten a kid to talk to me about school.</p>
