<p><b>For myself,<&#47;b></p>
<p><em>What did I do today?<&#47;em><br />
I did not avoid anything on my to-do list, which included exercising and brushing my teeth.  I ate a meal made from scratch.  I listened to music.</p>
<p><em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em><br />
I wanted to do all the things above and to reply to all my emails for the day and move the plywood from in front of the piano.</p>
<p><b>For my community,<&#47;b></p>
<p><em>What did I do today?<&#47;em><br />
I posted about this week's <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wiki.workatjelly.com&#47;JellyInSanDiego">Jelly<&#47;a>, and updated the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wintrisstech.org&#47;">Wintriss Tech<&#47;a> subversion server.</p>
<p><em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em><br />
I wanted to organize a Big Apple practice for this weekend, and reply to all of my blog comments.</p>
<p><b>For others,<&#47;b></p>
<p><em>What did I do today?<&#47;em><br />
I brought up dancing and Innovations Academy in conversation.  I got two students over a hill in computer programming.</p>
<p><em>What do I want to have done today?<&#47;em><br />
I want to have gotten 100 kids excited about living. </p>
<p>Here's to a better tomorrow.</p>
