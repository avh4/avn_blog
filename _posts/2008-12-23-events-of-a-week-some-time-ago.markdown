<p>Rube Goldberg couldn't have devised a better machine:</p>
<p><b>How to relax on a Sunday afternoon<&#47;b></p>
<p>Summer weather (A) arrives causing very warm temperatures and sunny days (B) which causes young man (C) to substantially increase his physical activity stimulating the production of testosterone (D).  Increased libido (E) creates romantic fantasies about attractive young woman (F).  Desire to impress young woman causes young man to organize a dance party (G) with good friends (H).  Friends hang out after dancing late into the night (I).  Sleep schedule (J) is upset causing young man to nap (K) throughout Sunday afternoon, thereby expending the day in idle content.</p>
<p>"His cartoons were, as he said, symbols of man's capacity for exerting maximum effort to accomplish minimal results. Rube believed that there were two ways to do things: the simple way and the hard way, and that a surprisingly number of people preferred doing things the hard way." (unsourced quote)</p>
