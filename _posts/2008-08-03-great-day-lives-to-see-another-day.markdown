<p>I don't know about you all, but I had a great day!  I got to catch up (half way) with Eva, and have an unexpectedly extended conversation with Colleen.  I made it past the half-way point in a novel for the first time on months (Memoirs of a Geisha).  I also went out with a new meetup group to see The Dark Night.  We spent two and a half hours having dinner before the movie, and I'm excited to say that I really impressed myself!  I wasn't the quietest person at the table; I started some great one-on-one conversations; I made people laugh; I led the conversation to things that are really important to me; I talked with the waitress (several times); and even had a moment where six people were simultaneously all listening to me intently.  I'm so used to feeling nervous or self-conscious or boring or uncertain that I'm quite simply amazed at myself.  Thus, I declare this day a "great day" :)</p>
<p>Also, it's the third day in a row that I've avoided using my car (I've biked about 60 miles instead)!</p>
<p>But I'm still a little afraid about my life.  Batman portrays an endless struggle between good and evil, and I worry about my life because I've never seen evil.  I honestly don't believe in lying or cheating or in children who get stolen from the playground or in women get raped on the streets of New York.  Original sin?  I've always had a problem with that concept: okay, so we sinned; let's repent and get on with and drag the guilt on for 2,000 years.  I really think that every person is consciously trying to solve our problems--and we're not stuck in a loop; we're continually building more and more wonderful things every day.  But yet I know that rape and murder and theft and vandalism all happen.  There must be things in the world that I don't understand--and can't even imagine.  Am I living in an ivory tower?  I need to see more of life's nastiest things and life's nastiest people.  And I wonder if seeing more will defeat my optimism or twist it somehow.  I've been looking for years and years to find the dark side of human nature--both in myself and in people around me--and I've never yet seen it.  So I wonder if I simply have a gift for seeing optimism or if I've been permanently blinded by it and am at the end of an ugly joke.</p>
<p>And while we ponder that, let's save the planet to keep our hands busy.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
