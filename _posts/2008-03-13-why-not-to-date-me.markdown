<p>I've been wondering what people mean when they tell me they don't want to be "more than friends" with me.  I've been hearing that a lot lately, and I've been wondering what I've done to provoke that statement.</p>
<p>My habitual response is to take it personally:  I wonder if I'm coming off as insensitive, or too geeky, or weird, or not having a melodic enough voice.  The big one I'm scared of is that I seem sexually boring.</p>
<p>I got a different perspective on it talking with my friend Andra today; she told me that she will often say that to guys simply as a preventative measure, and for the first time I started to consider that the statement maybe has more to do with the woman than with me.  Andra explained that what distinguishes "dating" from "hanging out" for her is that when she's "dating" someone, she wants to spend every moment with that person, and she gives up many of her other interests to spend time with her boyfriend.  In that context, it makes a lot more sense when Andra tells me she wants to be "just friends"-- what she's trying to tell me is that she can't possibly imagine (and is determined to avoid) a future where she would want to focus on me at the expense of her other interests.  ...  Put that way, I'm honestly glad she doesn't want to date me!  I don't ever want her to focus on me at the expense of her other interests either!</p>
<p>It's not difficult to suppose that other women who have given me the "just friends" line have been responding to a fear of their own, rather than making some vague criticism of me.  It's a relief not to have to take it personally any more :)</p>
<p>P.S. </p>
<p>But I'm not sure where this leaves me-- I'd like for someone to want to date me, but I certainly don't want it to be someone who would sacrifice other parts of her life, (or "settle") for me.  I want someone who is excited by me, but I want her to be strong enough not to give in to her excitement and who would put honest effort into the relationship despite the relationship's ease.  And that seems nearly identical to wanting someone who isn't excited by me, but who is strong enough not to give into her fears and who would put in honest effort into the relationship despite the relationship's difficulty.</p>
