<p>Well... um... Hi.  Tonight's a little weird for me: there's nothing I need to write about.  I've been using this blog to help give myself clarity and accountability in working out some of the more difficult parts of my life.  I've basically been writing about whatever has been bothering me at the time, including social skills, how to make a difference in the world, how to connect with people, how to be happy with myself, and how to find a relationship.  </p>
<p>But tonight what's bothering me is nothing I ever expected: nothing!  Tonight I have no problems.  And I honestly can't remember a time like this since high school.  I feel like my life is now in functioning condition--I don't need to spend any more time fixing it; I can move on to the real business of living life!</p>
<p>So okay, what is the real business?  I've spent 12 years trying to fix myself and get my life in order so that I could do ... what?  I've spent so long preparing that I've forgotten what I was aiming for in the first place.  So I guess I'm ready to start from scratch again.  I'm 14 years old and excited about life :-D</p>
<p>So I'm looking through the news, figuring I could find something interesting to write about.  But everything there seems so negative.  There's a lot of stuff about internet technology growing to overtake our privacy and freedom.  I'm not really interested in writing about that, since I think those issues are problems with people rather than problems with the technology.</p>
<p>But I wonder if perhaps it's time to think what as a society we want to build.  We have a lot of science and technology these days, but there's not really a general feeling that it's leading us to a better future.  I think as a global community, there's really no consensus about where the human race is headed.  Do we want to live in peace?  Do we want to explore the galaxy?  Do we want to live in a virtual world?  Do we want to create our own life forms?  Do we want to create art?  Is there a business plan for how we're going to use the available planetary resources?  Two thousand years from now, what do we want life to look like?</p>
<p>Well that's all I've got for tonight.  No answers, but just some thoughts.  I can't wait to get back to work on some projects.  Oh, and I have this link to share: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blog.perfectspace.com&#47;2008&#47;10&#47;15&#47;the-power-of-the-project&#47;">Nate Ritter - The Power of the Project<&#47;a></p>
<p>P.S.  I haven't replied to everyone's comments to my previous posts yet since I haven't had stable internet in a while.  But thank you!  I'll get back to them within a few weeks.</p>
